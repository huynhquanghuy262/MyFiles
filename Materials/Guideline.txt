Below steps are defined to help new members understand basicly about ADSP system in short time
    - Understand basic communication flow between layers: ADSP driver, framework and plugins
    - Sequence flow of each functions called from user to data processed in HW for the function
    
1. Fist of all: please read Audio_Framework_Specification.pdf to have whole image of the audio framework and each of its components as well as to explain the communication between them.

2. Answer to below questions: 
    - What is ADSP and purpose of it? 
    
    - Which functions of ADSP? 
    
    - List of use case ADSP?
        Read ADSP ALSA UM List of Usage section
    
    - Which component of ADSP system and it's function?
    
    - What is ALSA? 
        https://www.alsa-project.org
        
    - Which is basic work flow of audio application use ALSA interface 
        https://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/alsa-lib/examples.html
        
    - Which APIs of ADSP ALSA driver maps with API of ALSA framework 
        Check User Manual of ADSP ALSA driver and understand purpose of these APIs
        
    - How ALSA framework playback or record a stream through ADSP ALSA driver
        Check User Manual of ADSP ALSA driver (sequence flow section)
        
    - Which is detail of above APIs 
        Check source code
        
    - Which APIs of Renderer/Capture plugin maps with command message called in APIs of ADSP ALSA (Focus on these plugins first and focus on mapping between ADSP ALSA driver and Renderer/Capture plugins. It is easy to catch up workflow quickly)
        Firstly read ADSP Framework's UM to know mean of each command message, purpose
        
    - Which is detail of above APIs?
        Check soure code
    
    - How data processed in Renderer/Capture plugin(command processed, memory, buffer, format of data depend on PCM width)?
        Renderer: From get buffer from ADSP memory to transfer to SSI
        Capture: From SSI to ADSP memory
        
    - Which is HW modules related to audio: SSI, SCU, ADG, ADMAC, ADMACpp and FIFO? Purpose of it?
        Read overview of Renderer/Capture UM to know modules, read HW UM to know function of these modules
        
    - Which is operation of these HW modules (check soure code, focus on SSI, ADG first)?
        Read source code to know operation
